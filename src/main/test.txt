When you are ready, your job is to cover your code with tests,
and make an assertion for all the statements in the bulletpoints.
Whenever you are testing FileWordAnalyzer, be sure to mock out
the FilePartReader object manually. Here the sense of mocking is
that we'd only like to test the FileWordAnalyzer in itself,
and we don't want to take care about the underlying layer's behaviour (FilePartReader),
since it's already tested in it's own test cases.
When testing FilePartReader class,
you can have a test file with which
you can test the read method.
